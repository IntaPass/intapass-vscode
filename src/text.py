def send_money(account: int, name: str) -> bool:
    
    """Transfers money to the specified account.
    
    This function initiates a transaction to send money to the account associated with the provided name. It performs necessary validations on the account details and ensures the account exists and is active before proceeding with the transaction.
    
    Parameters:
    - account (int): The account number to which money will be sent. Must be a valid and active account number.
    - name (str): The name of the account holder. This is used for additional validation to ensure the account number matches the account holder's name.
    
    Returns:
    - bool: True if the transaction was successful, False otherwise. A return value of False could indicate an invalid account number, a mismatch between the account number and the holder's name, or a failure in the transaction process.
    
    Raises:
    - ValueError: If the `account` or `name` parameters do not meet validation criteria, such as if they are empty or in an invalid format.
    - ConnectionError: If there is a problem connecting to the bank's transaction system.
    
    Note:
    - This is a simplified example for documentation purposes. Actual implementation details, such as connecting to a bank's API and handling transactions, are not covered here."""
